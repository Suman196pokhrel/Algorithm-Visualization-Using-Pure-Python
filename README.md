# Algorithm-Visualization-Using-Pure-Python
This Application Consists of a GUI Interface from which user is able to manipulate the Type of Algo to be executed, Speed of Algo Execution and many more features. Some of the modules used in this entire project are, Tkinter, Sys, Random, Pygame,Partial

NOTE :: The Application For now Only Supports 3 Algorithms,
1>> Bubble Sort
2>> Linear Search
3>> Binary Search

These Algo still needs to be Optimized But its Doable.

Used Modules:
Tkinter - For UI
Pygame - for Visualization Drawings
Random - For generating Random bars in the window on which various sorting and searching algorithms are applied


The Application is not Completed , it still needs a whole bunch of Algos , 
feel free to create new branches and contribute,
ENJOY>>>>>
